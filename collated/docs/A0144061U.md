##Description
Tdoo Schedule Manager is a Command Line Interface Task Management Application that helps you manage your workflow.<br>
There are three main types of a task: Todo, Event and Deadline. Todo is a floating task that does not have a specific starting or ending time. When adding a Todo, you can set the priority of the task, so that you can strategise your work priority. Event is a task with specific start and end date/time. Deadline is a task with only end date and time. All three types of tasks can be marked as 'done' by the user, which is indicated by green in the interface. Events and Deadlines will be marked as 'Overdue', which is indicated by red, once the current time passes the end date/time, if they are not marked as 'done'. <br>
Once you type in a command to the command box, it will be reflected in the three task lists with three different task types. For most of the commands, it is required to specifiy which type of task is to be manipulated. Refer to the [Features](#features) section for more detail.

For Evnet/Deadline List, the tasks are arranged by their date. Those with earlier starting/ending date are shifted up and those with later starting/ending date are shifted down.

Task-list data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data.<br>
