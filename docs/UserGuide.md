##Description
Tdoo Schedule Manager is a Command Line Interface Task Management Application that helps you manage your workflow. There are two main parts in the app: Todo List in which you can plan what tasks are to be done for the day, and Calendar that you indicate deadlines of the tasks or events to attend weekly/monthly. Data in Todo List and Calendar are synchronized. For instance, if a task is done before a deadline, it will be indicated as `done` in Calendar as well. At each starting time of tasks in Todo List, the app will give a notification that you should start working.
